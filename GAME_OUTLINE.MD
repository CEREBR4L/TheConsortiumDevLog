# **The Consortium: Game Outline**

A 2D top-down futuristic colony simulator, resource management and automation game built in unity.

The Consortium is the largest group of companies in the known universe that complete a range of expeditions to gather resources and create products. These projects range from small resource-gathering colonies that operate on asteroids that hollow out and consume all the resources possible to large colonies on planets all over the traversable universe that establish colonies that last lifetimes and build up expansive processing and production lines as well as large populations that must be sustained all in the name of profit.
 
The consortium operates from a planetary system known only as the “CONTROL SYSTEM”. Within that system lays their main facility and operations control aptly named “CONTROL Base” from here the consortium controls and operates an extensive transport network to move people, resources and machines around what is known as the “traversable universe” in other words the places people can get to. This network is built up of gates that provide faster-than-light (FTL) transport but they come at a cost to use and only go where The Consortium dictates is worthwhile.

As a convicted criminal that has been entered into a programme called “The Consortium Freedom Project” that allows the prisoners to complete their sentence by fulfilling a contract for a mega-conglomerate “The Consortium”, the player will start out with a planet assigned to them that they must forge into a successful mining colony.

The Consortium Freedom Project will have the player start with a range of resources, people and help from The Consortium to get the colony off the ground, just enough to become self-sufficient. 

Moving through the first stages and once becoming self-sufficient the player will then be presented with their stage one goals and will have to build up the colony to produce specified amounts of resources, research and products. 

These goals will scale up through stages two and three additionally in stage two of the contract the player will be required to get the colony to become a space-faring people again, they will be required to get launch pads built and rockets constructed as well as all the supporting buildings and infrastructure.

In the third and final stage of the consortium contract, the player will be continuing to increase resource output as well as raise the overall value of the colony to a figure set by The Consortium. Additionally, the colony must create a new FTL gate for The Consortium to serve the transport network as well as transport both the resources and the colony back to “CONTROL SYSTEM”. 

Throughout this process, the player will be guided and advised by a “Freedom Success Specialist” who will communicate goals and outline what is required to meet the outlined demands and make sure the convict stays on-task. 
Having fulfilled the requirements and demands of “The Consortium Freedom Project” contract the player will then be shipped back to “CONTROL Base” where they will then be presented with a few options to found their own company as part of The Consortium. These options will be variations of the same deal, in essence, a loan that outlines various terms and conditions that allow the player to enter into the business of hollowing out rocks for products, energy, and profit.  

The player will find in founding their own company all the technology, assistance and transport they had access to is no longer freely available. Assistance can be provided, for a price. Transport can be provided, for a price. Technology will have to be built up from scratch with their own R&D and resources. They will have to essentially start from near nothing, building up from asteroid mining all the way to full-scale planet-conquering projects that produce mega-structures.

To start out however the player will need to buy the rights to a nearby asteroid that they can use to kick-start their cash flow, begin research and development, and ultimately be on their way to becoming a successful company. 

The ability to buy and sell celestial objects will be freely available to the player at all times from a marketplace provided by the consortium for seamless inter-company trading. 

It will be possible for the player to own many different celestial objects at the same time: planets, asteroids, and moons. All collaborating to produce profit, increase research and development, add to the transport network, and discover new systems. Upon finding a new system the player would, by the rules of the universal pact, own the rights to all celestial objects within it. 

As the player increases the value of their company and launches more projects they will be able to unlock various paths for profiting through the research and development system. The ability to turn old hollowed-out asteroid mines into floating storage facilities or convert them into new processing or production facilities. These can then in turn be used to support the players' ever-growing network of projects or provided as a service to other companies in need of such facilities for a price.

Depending on the paths the player walks down the tech tree will determine: what projects they are able to take on; the services they can provide; the products they can produce; the speed they are able to travel. 

Once the player has stabilized their company they should have or be close to closing out the loan agreement with The Consortium, allowing them to then take full advantage of what they have built.   

Here onwards the goal is to grow the company as large as possible to get to a point where the player can consume the entire consortium and take full control of everything they owned as a collective. They will do this by buying other companies, merging with companies, and acquiring others businesses projects. Once this has been achieved the player can choose to found their own consortium around themselves or simply overthrow and conquer the largest company in the universe.
Built-in progress will stop from here but the player can choose to play on founding further projects, completing R&D tech tree(s), trading with other companies, and climbing community leaderboards. 

However, for players looking for an exit, they can choose an option to retire in which they would sell what they have built and no longer be allowed to progress in this save. They will be able to access a full game history and view a range of data associated with the playthrough at any time from the main menu - these will also be made available through the web interface that will display leaderboards. 

There will be three leaderboards available: global, active play-throughs, and retirees. Global is the leaderboard with everyone. Active is players still progressing in their company. Retirees are those that have ruled the universe and hung up their space suits.
